# Account and Data Deletion for Mood Wellness and Recipe

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Do I have an account in this app?

No. **Mood Wellness and Recipe does not create or store any online accounts.**

- There is **no login, registration, or profile** in this app.
- All data (mood logs, recipes, and settings) is stored **only on your device**.
- We **do not** store any of your data on our servers or in the cloud.

Because we do not have any server-side account or personal data, there is **no remote account for us to delete**.

## 2. How to delete your data

Since all of your information is stored locally on your device, you can delete your data in the following ways:

- **Delete individual items inside the app**
  - You can manually delete:
    - Specific mood entries
    - Specific recipes

- **Delete all app data at once (recommended)**
  - On Android:
    1. Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Mood Wellness and Recipe**
    2. Tap **Storage & cache** (or similar)
    3. Tap **Clear storage / Clear data**
       - This will permanently delete all mood logs, recipes, and app settings from your device.
  - Or simply **uninstall the app**, which removes all locally stored data.

> Once data is deleted from your device, we cannot recover it because we never receive a copy of it.
